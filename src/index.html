        <p>Old Dominion Men’s Recovery Center’s (ODMRC) mission is to serve the needs of men seeking traditional 12-step recovery approaches. Our goal as a business isn’t to climb to the treatment industry summit, but rather to serve as the humble and well functioning hill beside it – well functioning for YOU because we view each of our members and their support system as their own grassroots addiction recovery coalition. We’re completely private, and not beholden to anyone except you and your support system – not insurance, grant funding, or pharmaceutical companies. Our program is for the recovering, by the recovering, and based on the social micro recovery model. The program outline in your hands seeks to highlight the differences at ODMRC.</p>
